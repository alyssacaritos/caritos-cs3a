        The Applied Cryptography Application project aims to develop a simple application that implements various cryptographic techniques to secure communication, data, and information exchange. Cryptography is the science of encoding and decoding messages to protect their confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. 

        This application covers the following cryptographic techniques:
        
        - **Symmetric Encryption and Decryption**: In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It's fast and efficient but requires secure key distribution. Examples include the Block Cipher XOR, XOR Cipher, and Caesar Cipher.

        - **Asymmetric Encryption and Decryption**: Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys - public and private keys. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. It provides secure key exchange but is slower compared to symmetric encryption. An example is the Secure Chat with Diffie-Hellman and RSA Encryption and Decryption.

        - **Hashing Function**: Hashing functions take an input (or 'message') and return a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a hash value. Hash functions are commonly used in various aspects of cryptography, including password storage and digital signatures.
        
        The application will provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to encrypt, decrypt, and hash messages/files using different cryptographic algorithms ü§ñ.
